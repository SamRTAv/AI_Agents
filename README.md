# 🧠 Deep Learning with PyTorch & Transformers

Welcome to this repository! Here's a quick overview of the contents:

##  PyTorch Data Preprocessing Notebook
- A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook demonstrating **data preprocessing** techniques using **PyTorch**.
- Covers essential steps for preparing data in **deep learning** and **transformer-based** architectures.

##  Mini Project: NanoGPT on Harry Potter
- A mini-project using **NanoGPT**, a lightweight GPT implementation.
- Trained on the complete **Harry Potter series** (all seven `.txt` files).
- Capable of generating creative continuations — possibly a whole new ending to the series! 😎

##  Upcoming Additions
Stay tuned for more exciting content:
-  Mini-projects implementing **LSTM** and **CNN** models in PyTorch.
-  Jupyter Notebooks explaining the **Attention Mechanism** in Transformer architectures
